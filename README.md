# iOSClassMate
 Application developed by SUSHANTH AVVARU REDID: 819693674 
The iOS Application is called Classmate. This is Multi-view, Tabled, Multi-media Application. Itâ€™s a recording application that allows you to record audio of the lecture in class. The recorded files are stored according to the class which you record it. 
  When you start the application, click on the class name and record the class. All the lectures are stored in lecture tab. 
Limitations :- However I added an option to delete the class name in the first view by swiping left on the class, but the class name loads back into the app when we close the app and start again because its predefined list of classes.
